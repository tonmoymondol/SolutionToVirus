# SolutionToVirus
My Idea for the solution of the coronavirus outbreak is: Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly. Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19. A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection. The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity. The same model can be used to find potential candidate for conducting random tests. Machine Learning model parameters:- A team of doctors can sit down to find out the best model parameters. A sample set of parameters is as follow: Features: Average Fever-Continous Body Pain-0/1 Binary Age-Discrete Runny Nose Breathing Problem- Categorical: 0/1/-1 Labels: Probability of COVID-19 Infection
